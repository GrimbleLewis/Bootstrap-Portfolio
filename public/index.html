                <p class="mt-3">Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Tyler Lewis and I am embarking on my journey of becoming a junior web developer, thank you for stopping by
                        to see all of the progress I've made so far! I'll describe myself here so you get an idea about who I am.  I graduated from the University of Richmond
                        in 2016 with a degree in IT Management. I currently do not work in the field but with this bootcamp I plan to change that! <br><br> I have always been 
                        interested in computers more from a gaming aspect but knew that I wanted to base my career around IT. I've attempted to learn coding on my own but without
                        a proper structure I found it difficult to grasp some of the concepts, that is why I am excited for this bootcamp and to work closely with people already in 
                        the field as well as my junior developers in training classmates. <br><br> I spend most of my free time playing video games or reading/listening
                        to audiobooks. I have recently been listening to Stephen King books, I enjoy his storytelling and love to get enthralled in the worlds he builds. As far as gaming
                        goes I mostly enjoy strategy-based games and card games. I like multiplayer battle royal games but prefer a more story driven single player campaign.
                        <br>
